âš¡ A fast, stable, will supported server software for Minecraft: Java Edition.

## Why another fork

This fork is a solid base of my server, and I made it public for everyone to use.

We targeted on some bad performance part of this game (Such as chunk loading, entity ticking, etc.) and try our best to make them faster instead mixing a lot of useless patches together.

At the same time, the API will be also extended and powerful for those people who develop plugins.
